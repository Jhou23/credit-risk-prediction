# Customer Propensity to Pay Prediction

# Problem Background
B2B collections continue to be dependent on basic and homogenous strategies that are defined by customer’s ageing bucket and binary measures of credit worthiness. Given the ever increasing focus on Cash Flow and Working Capital as measures of companies’ financial health, collections operations need more sophistication in segmenting their customers and leverage predictive models in strategy formulation & execution. Collection of debt also needs to be more dynamic and real time in measuring effectiveness of strategies and iteratively modifying models and strategies. The objective is to create a model to predict the propensity to pay of customers studying patterns from the historical
payments.
